# VeritX Vision — Website SDD (Software Design Document)

**Purpose of this file:** a self-contained snapshot of the site's current state — structure, content,
design decisions, and constraints — so a future session can make changes without re-reading every
source file or re-deriving decisions that were already made and settled. If this file and the actual
code ever disagree, **the code is the source of truth**; update this file to match it.

## 1. What this is

A bilingual (Spanish/English) marketing website for **VeritX Vision**, a fictional/prototype product
by a company headquartered in Tlaxcala, Mexico, building an AI-powered fabric-defect-inspection system
("Vision A") for textile manufacturers. It is a single-page marketing site plus several satellite pages
(Demo, Calculator, About) **and a client-only-simulated customer portal** (Login, Register, email
verification, password/username recovery, and a "Vision Home" account dashboard — see §14), all
client-side routed.

- **Live site (GitHub Pages):** https://ismael-galaviz.github.io/defect-detection/
- **Live site (Vercel):** the repo is also connected to Vercel directly — URL not recorded here yet
  (fill in once known; it'll be a `*.vercel.app` subdomain unless a custom domain is attached).
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/ismael-galaviz/defect-detection (branch `main`)
- **Git root:** this directory (`02_Website_Code/frontend/veritx-web`) — the repo does **not** include
  the rest of the `Defect Detection` project tree (images, project code, diagrams, etc. are siblings,
  outside git).
- **Hosting:** two independent targets build from the same `main` branch — GitHub Pages (via GitHub
  Actions, §2) and Vercel (via Vercel's own git integration, §2). See §2's "Vite config" note for how a
  single `vite.config.js` serves both without per-target manual steps.

---

## 2. Tech stack

- **React 18** + **Vite 5** (`@vitejs/plugin-react`). No TypeScript, no CSS framework, no component
  library, no router library (routing is a ~10-line custom hash hook — see §4).
- Styling: one hand-written global stylesheet, `src/index.css` (~1035 lines), using CSS custom
  properties for the palette and plain class selectors. No CSS Modules, no styled-components.
- Icons: hand-drawn inline SVG paths (no icon library dependency) — see §6.
- State: local `useState`/`useEffect` only. No Redux/Zustand/Context beyond the language provider.
- No test suite, no linter config.
- `package.json` deps: `react`, `react-dom` (runtime); `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react` (dev).

### Build & dev

```bash
npm install        # if node_modules is missing/stale
npm run dev         # Vite dev server
npm run build        # production build to dist/
npm run preview      # preview the production build locally
```

**Known local-env quirk:** npm's optional-dependency resolution sometimes omits the native Rollup
binary (`@rollup/rollup-<platform>`), causing `npm run build` to fail with a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a
native `.node` file. Fix: re-run `npm install`.

**Dev server port:** the repo's own Vite config has no fixed port, but in this environment port 5173
was already taken by another app, so the harness's dev-server launcher
(`02_Website_Code/.claude/launch.json`, **one level above this repo, not git-tracked by it**) pins the
dev server to port 5199 via `--port 5199 --strictPort` and runs it with `--prefix frontend/veritx-web`
from the `02_Website_Code` directory. This file is a local tooling convenience, not part of the
deployed app.

### Vite config (`vite.config.js`)

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: process.env.VERCEL ? '/' : '/defect-detection/',
})
```

**Two deploy targets, one config.** GitHub Pages serves this repo as a *project site* under
`/defect-detection/`, so every asset URL needs that path prefix baked in at build time. Vercel serves it
at the domain root (its own subdomain, or a custom domain later), where that same prefix would 404 every
JS/CSS asset. Vercel automatically sets the `VERCEL` env var during its builds (no manual config needed
on Vercel's side for this), so `base` branches on it: `'/'` under Vercel, `'/defect-detection/'`
everywhere else (including local `npm run build`, which is why a plain local build still matches what
GitHub Pages expects). If the GitHub Pages repo is ever renamed, or Pages moves to a custom domain,
update the non-Vercel branch of this ternary and re-deploy.

### Deploy — GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

Triggers on push to `main`/`master` or manual dispatch. Steps: checkout → Node 20 → `npm ci` →
`npm run build` → upload `./dist` as a Pages artifact → deploy. Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3`
and `actions/deploy-pages@v4`. (CI currently warns that Node 20 is deprecated on the runner image and
is being forced onto Node 24 — cosmetic, not currently broken; bump `node-version` to `24` if it starts
to matter.)

### Deploy — Vercel

The repo has also been connected to Vercel directly (its own git integration, not a GitHub Actions
step) — it rebuilds and redeploys on every push the same way GitHub Pages does, independently. **No
`vercel.json` exists and none is needed**: Vercel auto-detects this as a Vite project (framework preset
"Vite") from `package.json`/`vite.config.js` at the repo root and defaults to `npm run build` +
`dist` as the output directory, which already match. Routing needs no rewrite rules either, since every
route in this app is a `#/...` hash fragment (§4) — the browser never asks the server for
`/login` or `/vision-home` as a path, only ever for `/`, so there's nothing for Vercel to redirect.
**The one thing that had to change for Vercel to work at all** was `base` in `vite.config.js` (above) —
without the `VERCEL`-conditional, the site would build with GitHub Pages' `/defect-detection/` prefix
baked in and every asset would 404 on Vercel's root-served domain. If Vercel's dashboard ever shows a
"Root Directory" setting, it should stay blank/unset — `package.json` already sits at the git root
(§1's "Git root" note), so there's no nested-folder monorepo indirection for Vercel to account for.

### `.gitignore`

There is no `components/` subfolder — every home-page section component (`Header`, `Hero`, `VisionA`,
`HowItWorks`, `UseCases`, `Comparison`, `Specs`, `Contact`, `Footer`, plus small helpers `LangSwitch`,
`NavDropdown`, `MobileAccordion`, `MadeInMexicoBadge`) lives directly in `App.jsx` as sibling function
components, in the order they render. `Site()` is the component that assembles them per route; `App()`
just wraps `Site` in `LanguageProvider`. The customer-portal pages (§14) each get their own file,
following the same one-file-per-satellite-page convention as `DemoPage.jsx`/`CalculatorPage.jsx`/`AboutPage.jsx`.

---

## 4. Routing

No router library. `useRoute()` (top of `App.jsx`) reads `window.location.hash`, listens for
`hashchange`, and maps it to one of these route names:

| hash prefix | route |
|---|---|
| `#/demo` | `demo` → renders `<DemoPage/>` |
| `#/calculator` | `calculator` → renders `<CalculatorPage/>` |
| `#/about` | `about` → renders `<AboutPage/>` |
| `#/login` | `login` → renders `<LoginPage/>` |
| `#/register` | `register` → renders `<RegisterPage/>` |
| `#/verify-email` (+ `?token=`) | `verify-email` → renders `<VerifyEmailPage/>` |
| `#/forgot-password` (+ optional `?token=`) | `forgot-password` → renders `<ForgotPasswordPage/>` (request view if no token, reset view if a token is present) |
| `#/recover-username` | `recover-username` → renders `<RecoverUsernamePage/>` |
| `#/vision-home` | `vision-home` → renders `<VisionHomePage/>` (redirects to `#/login` client-side if there's no session — see §14) |
| anything else (incl. plain `#section-id` anchors) | `home` → renders the full home-page section stack |

All nine non-`home` route names are collected in the `SATELLITE_ROUTES` array (top of `App.jsx`, right
above `useRoute()`) so the scroll-to-top effect below and any future "is this a satellite page" check
stay in sync with one list instead of a repeated `route === 'x' || route === 'y' || ...` chain.

`<Header/>` and `<Footer/>` always render regardless of route.

On route change, `Site()`'s `useEffect`:
- scrolls to top (`window.scrollTo(0,0)`) for any route in `SATELLITE_ROUTES`,
- otherwise (route `home`), if the current hash is a plain anchor (doesn't start with `#/`), scrolls
  that element into view via `document.getElementById(hash.slice(1))?.scrollIntoView()`.

**Query strings on hash routes:** `#/verify-email?token=...` and `#/forgot-password?token=...` carry a
token as a query string appended directly to the hash fragment (not a "real" URL query string, since
everything after `#` is opaque to the browser/server — this is a static site with no server-side
routing anyway). Each page reads it with a small `getTokenFromHash()` helper:
`new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.split('?')[1] || '').get('token')`. `useRoute()`'s
`hash.startsWith('#/forgot-password')` check matches both the bare and `?token=`-suffixed forms since
the query string comes right after the route segment.

This means an in-page anchor like `#contact` works both when already on `home` (native browser anchor
scroll, assisted by `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` in CSS) **and** when clicked from a satellite
page (e.g. Calculator's CTA linking to `#contact` — the hash change flips the route back to `home`,
which mounts the Contact section, and the effect above scrolls to it).

**To add a new page/route:** add a `hash.startsWith('#/whatever')` branch in `useRoute()`, add
`{route === 'whatever' && <WhateverPage/>}` in `Site()`, import the new page component, and add it to
`route === 'home' || route === 'demo' || ...` in the top-scroll `useEffect` condition if it should
scroll-to-top on entry (satellite pages do; anchor-style routes don't).

---

## 5. i18n system

`src/i18n.jsx` exports `LanguageProvider` and `useLanguage()`.

- `detectLanguage()`: reads `localStorage['veritx-lang']`; if it's `'en'` or `'es'`, use it; **otherwise
  defaults to `'es'`** (Spanish-first is intentional — the target audience is Mexico/LatAm-first, per
  explicit product decision, not a browser-language auto-detect).
- On every language change: persists to `localStorage['veritx-lang']` and sets
  `document.documentElement.lang` to match (so `index.html`'s static `lang="es"` is just the pre-JS
  default; the real value is runtime-managed).
- `useLanguage()` returns `{ lang, setLang, t }` where `t` is `translations[lang]` — the whole
  per-language object from `translations.js`. Components read copy as `t.section.field`.

**Language switcher UI** (`LangSwitch` in `App.jsx`): a native `<select>` styled to look custom
(class `lang-switch`), not a pair of buttons — two `<option>`s, each prefixed with a flag emoji:
`🇲🇽 ES` and `🇺🇸 EN`. This is the one place emoji are intentionally used (see §6 — everywhere else
emoji were replaced with SVG icons; flags here represent language/country identity, not decoration,
and were explicitly kept). Lives in the header, opens as a real native dropdown (per explicit
instruction: "que sea un dropbox", after an earlier iteration used two flag buttons).

**To add a language:** add a new top-level key to `translations.js` (e.g. `pt: {...}` mirroring the
full shape of `en`/`es`), add an `<option>` in `LangSwitch`, and extend `detectLanguage`'s validity
check.

---

## 6. Icon system (`src/icons.jsx`)

A single exported component:

```jsx
export function Icon({ name, size = 22 }) {
  return (
    <svg width={size} height={size} viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"
         strokeWidth="1.8" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" aria-hidden="true">
      {ICON_PATHS[name]}
    </svg>
  )
}
```

All icons are **hand-drawn stroke-only SVG paths** (no icon library/font), colored via CSS
`color` on the parent element (they use `stroke="currentColor"`). This was a deliberate replacement of
an earlier emoji-based icon set ("cambia los emojis por iconos más serios y que el color sea el mismo
del tema de la página") — icons are consistently tinted with the brand cyan (`var(--cyan)` on dark
backgrounds, `var(--cyan-dark)` on light backgrounds), never left at default/emoji color, **except** the
language-switcher flags (see §5).

**Current icon names** (`ICON_PATHS` keys) and what they're used for:

| name | used in | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bolt` | Vision A feature 1 | Plug & play |
| `link` | Vision A feature 2 | Easy integration |
| `sliders` | Vision A feature 3 | Flexible to your process |
| `weave` | Use Cases card 1 | Fabric Production |
| `droplet` | Use Cases card 2 | Finishing |
| `eyeCheck` | Use Cases card 3 | Final Inspection (compound eye + checkmark-badge icon, explicitly requested) |
| `pause` | How It Works integration example 1 | "stop the line" |
| `tag` | How It Works integration example 2 | "trigger the labeling unit" |
| `mail` | Contact info row | Email us |
| `pin` | Contact info row, About facts | Location/HQ |
| `gear` | How It Works integration card | Machine-integration/automation |
| `target` | Why VeritX Vision card 1 | Industrial-grade accuracy |
| `activity` | Why VeritX Vision card 2 | Real-time inline inspection |
| `percent` | Why VeritX Vision card 3 | Accessible pricing |
| `cloud` | Why VeritX Vision card 4 | Cloud or on-premises |
| `globe` | About facts | "Where we serve" |
| `chevronDown` | Nav dropdown / mobile accordion triggers | Expand/collapse indicator (rotates 180° via `.chev.open`) |
| `clock` | Calculator, section 2 (labor hours); also reused for Vision Home's "next payment" and "schedule a meeting" cards | Time/hours |
| `gauge` | Calculator, section 3 (line speed) | Speed |
| `shield` | Calculator, soft savings | Customer trust/reputation |
| `clipboard` | Calculator, soft savings; also reused for Vision Home's "active subscriptions" card | Audits/certifications |
| `spark` | Calculator, soft savings | Employee experience |
| `whatsapp` | Contact info row | WhatsApp chat link (`wa.me/526462416056`) |
| `eye` / `eyeOff` | Login/Register/Reset-password forms | Show/hide password toggle (swapped by `showPassword` state) |
| `user` | Header account link/dropdown trigger | Login/My Account entry point |
| `flask` | Every auth page's "demo mode" panel (dummy-login banner, verification/reset dev-links, recover-username dev-panel) | Signals "this is simulated, not a real backend action" |
| `linkedin` | Footer, brand column | Social link icon (placeholder — see §11) |

`user`, `flask`, `eye`/`eyeOff`, and `linkedin` were added for the customer-portal work (§14); `whatsapp`
was added when a WhatsApp contact row was requested alongside the existing email row in `Contact()`.

**To add an icon:** add a `name: <path .../>` (or `<>...</>` fragment for multi-element icons) entry to
`ICON_PATHS` in `icons.jsx`, keeping the `viewBox="0 0 24 24"` coordinate space consistent with the
existing set so sizing behaves predictably.

## 7. Design tokens & layout conventions

CSS custom properties, defined on `:root` in `index.css`:

```css
--navy: #0B1F3A;
--navy-light: #12315c;
--cyan: #00D4FF;
--cyan-dark: #00a8cc;
--ink: #0d1b2a;
--gray-50: #f7f9fc;
--gray-100: #eef1f6;
--gray-300: #cbd5e1;
--gray-500: #64748b;
--gray-700: #334155;
--white: #ffffff;
--radius: 14px;
--max-width: 1180px;
```

Font: `'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
(no font is actually loaded/imported — this falls back to system fonts since Inter isn't linked
anywhere; cosmetic gap, not a bug per se).

**Section vertical padding** — base rule `section { padding: 77px 0; }`. This value (and the hero's
`80px 0 96px`, the demo/calculator/about hero's `58px 0`, and their content section's `51px 0 77px`)
are **already a 20%-reduced** version of the original design (96px / 100+120px / 72px / 64+96px) per
an explicit "reduce spacing 20%" request. If asked to adjust spacing again, these current numbers are
the baseline to scale from, not the original ones.

**Responsive breakpoints:** two, both `max-width` media queries — `900px` (the main one: collapses
grids to 1–2 columns, hides desktop nav, shows the hamburger) and `600px` (a couple of demo-page-only
tweaks). No `min-width` breakpoints are used.

**Container:** `.container { max-width: 1180px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 24px; }` — used inside every
section.

**Buttons:** `.btn` base + `.btn-primary` (cyan, dark navy text), `.btn-ghost` (transparent, white
border, for dark backgrounds), `.btn-dark` (navy bg, white text, used for the contact form submit).

**Card/section pattern reused across the site:** an icon in a small rounded square with a tinted cyan
background (`rgba(0,212,255, .1–.15)`), a heading, a paragraph. This exact visual pattern is shared by
Vision A features (`.vf-icon`), Use Cases cards (`.usecase-icon`), and the "Why VeritX Vision" cards
(`.usecase-icon` reused via the `why-grid` class — see §9.7) — reuse this pattern rather than inventing
a new card style when adding similar content.

**Pages that aren't the home page** (`DemoPage`, `CalculatorPage`, `AboutPage`) all share the same
two-part layout: a `<section className="demo-hero">` navy gradient banner with just an eyebrow + `<h1>`
(and optionally a lead paragraph / toolbar, as Demo does), followed by a `<section className="demo-section">`
light-gray content area. Reuse this `demo-hero` + `demo-section` pair for any new satellite page instead
of inventing new classes.

## 8. Component inventory (`App.jsx`)

In file order:

- **`useRoute()`** — hash-based router hook, see §4.
- **`LangSwitch()`** — native `<select>` language switcher, see §5.
- **`NavDropdown({ label, items, isOpen, onToggle, onNavigate })`** — a header nav item that's a button
  + absolutely-positioned panel of links. Controlled from outside (open/close state lives in `Header`).
- **`MobileAccordion({ label, items, onNavigate })`** — the mobile-hamburger-menu equivalent of
  `NavDropdown`; manages its own `open` state locally (each mobile menu section is independent, unlike
  desktop where only one dropdown can be open at a time).
- **`Header()`** — sticky header. Desktop nav, left to right: **Home** (plain link, `href="#"`) →
  **Product** (`NavDropdown`, `t.nav.productItems`) → **Calculate Savings** (plain link,
  `href="#/calculator"`, `t.nav.calculator` — renamed from "Calculator"/"Calculadora" to "Calculate
  Savings"/"Calcular ahorros") → **About Us** (`NavDropdown`, `t.nav.aboutItems`). Only one dropdown can
  be open at a time (`openDropdown` state: `null | 'product' | 'about' | 'account'` — see the account
  dropdown below). Dropdowns open **on click, not hover** (explicit choice — more accessible, consistent
  with mobile). Closed by: clicking its own trigger again, clicking any item inside it, clicking
  anywhere outside the dropdown's own container, or pressing `Escape`. Outside-click detection uses
  **two refs**, not one: `navRef` (wraps `nav.nav-links`, for `product`/`about`) and `accountRef` (wraps
  the account-menu `<div>`, for `account`) — the shared `mousedown` handler picks
  `openDropdown === 'account' ? accountRef : navRef` so each dropdown only reacts to clicks outside its
  own DOM subtree (a single shared ref would either fail to close the account menu when clicking a nav
  link, or vice versa). The mobile hamburger (`mobile-toggle` button, ☰/✕) toggles a separate
  `<nav className="mobile-menu">` that mirrors the same structure — Home link, Product
  `MobileAccordion`, Calculate Savings link, About Us `MobileAccordion`, plus the account link/logout
  row (see below). **There is no CTA button in the header** — deliberately removed once the header got
  crowded; the primary CTA lives in the hero, the contact section, and page-specific CTAs. **There used
  to be a third "Tools" dropdown** grouping Demo + Calculator together — Demo was explicitly removed
  from the nav (the `#/demo` route/page itself still exists and works, it's just unlinked — see §11),
  leaving Tools with only one item, so it was collapsed into the plain Calculate-Savings link described
  above rather than keeping a single-item dropdown. `DemoPage` is still imported and routed in `Site()`;
  only the nav link was removed. **Account link** (`nav-cta`, after `LangSwitch`): see the icon-only
  dropdown described in §6's icon table and §14.2 — this replaced an earlier icon+text-label version.
- **`Hero()`** — headline, lead paragraph, two CTAs (`#contact`, `#how-it-works`), three stat chips
  (`t.hero.stats`), and a decorative "scan frame" visual with two floating defect-tag labels
  (`t.hero.defectTags`) and an animated scan line (`@keyframes scan`, pure CSS). **The middle stat was
  changed from an abstract `'Flexible'` / "Install adapts to your machine" to a concrete number**:
  `'100%'` / "Of rolls inspected — not sampled" — requested as a "more tangible fact a business owner
  would find attractive" than a non-numeric value; the wording reuses the existing "inspects 100% of
  pieces consistently" claim already established in the ROI calculator copy (§10.16), not a new,
  unvalidated claim.
- **`VisionA()`** (`id="vision-a"`) — product intro section, right after Hero. Left: eyebrow/title/sub +
  3 feature rows (icon + title + body, from `t.visionA.features`). Right: **the visual column now holds
  only the 16:9 YouTube embed** (`.video-embed`, privacy-enhanced `youtube-nocookie.com` domain, video
  id `djK5l04jRoM`, accessible `title` from `t.visionA.videoTitle`) — no other content below it.
  **Superseded:** this column used to show a decorative CSS-only "device" mockup (`.device-frame`, pure
  CSS, no real image/animation asset) with a row of small pill tags (`t.visionA.tags`) *underneath* a
  separate full-width video embed. Both were explicitly removed in two steps — first the device mockup
  was replaced by moving the video into that spot, then the pill tags below it were removed outright —
  leaving just the single video. `t.visionA.tags` and the `.device-frame`/`.device-name`/`.device-bar`/
  `.device-beam`/`.device-fabric`/`.visiona-tags` CSS were deleted along with them; don't resurrect
  either without a fresh request. **The product video lives here (product description section), not on
  the About page** — it was initially added to About and explicitly moved to Vision A; if a second video
  is ever needed for About, that'd be a new addition, not "restoring" anything.
- **`HowItWorks()`** (`id="how-it-works"`) — 4-step numbered pipeline grid (`t.howItWorks.steps`,
  `.step-card`), plus one extra full-width dark **"integration card"** below the grid
  (`t.howItWorks.integration`) explaining that Vision A can trigger **client-defined actions** on
  severe defects (e.g. stop the line, trigger a labeling unit) — this card was explicitly requested as
  an "extra box", not a numbered step, and is visually distinct (navy gradient vs. the light step
  cards) for that reason.
- **`UseCases()`** (`id="use-cases"`) — 3-card grid, `t.useCases.cards` (Fabric Production, Finishing,
  Final Inspection).
- **`Comparison()`** (`id="comparison"`) — despite the id/name (kept for URL/nav-anchor stability), this
  is **not** a competitor-comparison table. It renders `t.comparison.cards` as a 4-card grid (class
  `usecases-grid why-grid` — reuses the use-cases card styling, `why-grid` just changes the grid to 4
  columns). **This was deliberately reworked from an earlier "VeritX vs. Legacy Systems" two-column
  table into standalone value-prop cards, per an explicit "don't compare to the competition" request.**
  Do not reintroduce a competitor/legacy-systems comparison here.
- **`Specs()`** (`id="specs"`) — dark navy section, 4 stat cards (`t.specs.cards`).
- **`Contact()`** (`id="contact"`) — two-column: left is contact info (`.contact-info`); right is the
  lead-gen form. **Left column layout:** an `.info-row-pair` puts "Email us" (`mail` icon) and "Chat on
  WhatsApp" (`whatsapp` icon, `href="https://wa.me/526462416056"`, opens in a new tab) side by side,
  with "Based in" (`pin` icon) as a full-width row below — the WhatsApp row was requested to sit next to
  the email row specifically, not stacked under it. `.info-row` (and its `a.info-row` link variant) is
  shared with `AboutPage`'s facts list. The form opens with a `.mode-toggle` (segmented control, `mode`
  state: `'message' | 'schedule'`). In `'schedule'` mode, an `<AppointmentPicker/>` renders between the
  stage select and the message textarea, and — schedule mode or not — a video-tool `<select>`
  (`a.videoTool`/`videoToolOptions`: Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp Video, Other) renders
  right after the picker so the visitor can say how they'd like to take the call — see §10.17 for its
  behavior. **On submit, the success message is scrolled into view** (`successRef` +
  `scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth', block:'center'})` in a `useEffect` keyed on `submitted`) — before
  this fix, submitting collapsed the tall schedule-mode form (with the date/time picker) down to a short
  success banner while the scroll position stayed put, leaving the visitor looking at the footer instead
  of the confirmation. See §9.6 and §10 for the form's exact fields, ordering, and behavior — it's the
  most complex component in the file.
- **`AppointmentPicker`** (defined just above `Contact()`) — a hand-built month-view calendar (no date
  library) plus a fixed set of business-hour time slots, all declared and labeled in **Mexico City time
  (CDMX)** regardless of the visitor's own timezone. See §10.17.
- **`MadeInMexicoBadge()`** — small decorative footer badge, pure CSS Mexican-flag color bar, no
  translated text (the "HECHO EN MÉXICO" label is hardcoded, not through `t`, since it's a fixed
  Spanish-language brand mark regardless of site language — this was an explicit request, not an
  oversight).
- **`Footer()`** — brand block (logo, tagline, a `.footer-social` row, the Mexico badge) + 3 link
  columns (`Product`, `Company`, `Legal`) + bottom bar (copyright only — see below). `.footer-social`
  currently holds one icon-only entry, LinkedIn (`Icon name="linkedin"`), rendered as a non-interactive
  `<span>` (no `href`) rather than a real `<a>` link — **there is no real company LinkedIn URL yet**;
  wire it up as a proper link once one exists (don't guess/fabricate a URL — see §11). The `Company`
  column is `About` (→ `#/about`) and `Contact` (→ `#contact`) — both real links; there is no `Careers`
  entry. **The `Legal` column is still not real links** — see §11. **Superseded:** the bottom bar used
  to include a second line, "Prototype product — specifications subject to change." — removed by
  request; `t.footer.prototype` no longer exists in either language, don't re-add it without being asked.
- **`Site()`** — route-to-component mapping, see §4.
- **`App()`** — default export, wraps `<Site/>` in `<LanguageProvider>`.

## 9. Content — full copy (both languages)

⚠️ **This section is now known-stale for parts of the file and is kept for the original marketing
copy only.** It was originally a full verbatim reproduction of `translations.js`, but the file has
since grown a large `auth` namespace (login/register/recovery/Vision Home copy — see §14.1) that is
**deliberately not reproduced here** (it would roughly double this document's length for content that's
easy to read directly in the source file), plus a number of smaller edits to the marketing copy below
that were **not** re-synced into this quoted block afterward: the hero's middle stat (§10.23), the
footer's removed "prototype" line (§8's `Footer()` entry), Vision A's removed device-mockup tags
(§8's `VisionA()` entry), the About page's added Vision/Mission section and WhatsApp contact row
(§10.25, §8's `Contact()` entry), the nav's "Calculator" → "Calculate Savings" rename (§10.22), and the
calculator's currency selector / send-results panel / relocated methodology note (§10.19–21). **For any
of those areas, or anything under `auth`, read `src/translations.js` directly — it is unambiguously the
source of truth.** The reproduction below is otherwise accurate for the rest of the site's copy as of
2026-08-13 (before this round of changes); trust the real file over this block for literally anything
that seems to disagree with it, per the standing rule at the top of this document.

## 10. Established decisions & constraints (read before changing content)

These are product/brand decisions that were **explicitly requested** during development. Don't
casually reverse them without the user re-confirming — re-litigating them wastes a round-trip.

1. **Default language is Spanish**, not browser-detected. English is opt-in via the header switcher.
2. **No competitor comparisons anywhere on the site.** The "Why VeritX Vision" section was rewritten
   from a "VeritX vs. Legacy Systems" table into standalone value-prop cards for exactly this reason.
   Don't reintroduce head-to-head competitor framing (explicit or implied) in that section or elsewhere.
3. **No specific installation-time promises** (e.g. "installs in < 48h"). Physical installation time
   varies by machine, so every mention of install time was changed to communicate **flexibility**
   instead of a fixed duration — see the hero stat, Vision A tags, and the "Why VeritX Vision" cards.
4. **CTA copy is "Request Contact" / "Solicitar contacto"** everywhere (hero, contact form submit,
   calculator placeholder) — not "Request a Demo"/"Solicitar demo" (an earlier version used that
   wording; it was explicitly renamed).
5. **No CTA button in the header** — removed once the header got crowded with the language switcher
   and 3 nav dropdowns. The primary CTA lives in content (hero, contact section, calculator page).
6. **Company facts, baked into copy:** HQ in **Tlaxcala, Mexico**; serves **Mexico, Latin America, and
   the world**; contact email **hello@veritxvision.com**. A "Hecho en México" footer badge with a small
   Mexican-flag-colored bar is present regardless of site language (hardcoded Spanish text — this is a
   fixed brand mark, not meant to translate to "Made in Mexico" in the English version).
7. **Superseded:** Demo and Calculator were briefly grouped under one "Tools"/"Herramientas" nav
   dropdown. **Demo was later explicitly removed from the nav entirely** (the page/route still exists,
   just unlinked), which left Tools with a single item, so it was collapsed into a direct "Calculator"
   top-level link instead of a single-item dropdown. Current nav: Home (link) → Product (dropdown) →
   Calculator (link) → About Us (dropdown). See §8's `Header()` entry.
8. **Contact form field order:** Name + Company (2-col row) → Work email + Country (2-col row) → Stage
   select (full width, with a dynamic hint) → Message (textarea) → Privacy policy `<details>` →
   required consent checkbox → Submit button.
9. **Country select ordering is fixed:** Mexico first (standalone, no group label), then a "Latin
   America"/"Latinoamérica" `<optgroup>`, then an "Other countries"/"Otros países" `<optgroup>` — in
   that order, always. This was an explicit ordering requirement, not alphabetical-everything.
10. **The "stage" select shows a contextual hint** below it in light gray (`.field-hint`, `var(--gray-500)`)
    explaining, per selected stage, why deploying there matters — updates live as the visitor picks a
    different option. This was an explicit request ("agrega ... una descripción corta del por qué...").
11. **Contact form requires explicit consent** — a required checkbox (blocks native form submission via
    HTML5 validation + a `setCustomValidity` localized message) paired with a collapsible `<details>`
    block summarizing what data is collected and why. This exists because of an explicit "add a data
    policy and request consent" instruction.
12. **Icons are hand-drawn SVG, not emoji**, tinted with the brand cyan — an explicit reversal of an
    earlier emoji-based version ("cambia los emojis por iconos más serios..."). The one deliberate
    exception is the language-switcher's flag emoji (🇲🇽/🇺🇸), which represent language/country identity
    rather than being decorative.
13. **Section vertical spacing was reduced 20%** from the original design values — see §7. If asked to
    adjust spacing again, treat the current CSS values as the baseline.
14. **The demo-page defect-map color palette is validated**, not arbitrary — see the comment at the top
    of `DemoPage.jsx`: colors were checked for CVD-safety and contrast against the navy map surface
    (`#10294a`) using the project's internal data-viz accessibility method (all-pairs CVD ΔE ≥ 9.4,
    normal-vision ΔE ≥ 20.9, contrast ≥ 3:1). If defect-type colors are ever changed, re-validate rather
    than picking colors by eye.
15. **The product video belongs on the Vision A / product-description section**, not the About page —
    explicitly corrected after an initial placement in About. See §8's `VisionA()` entry.
16. **The `#/calculator` page is a real, interactive ROI calculator**, sourced from a client-provided
    document (`Guia_Ingeniero_Calidad_ROI.docx`, a "Quality Engineer's ROI Guide") — not a placeholder.
    Three savings sections (defect reduction, manual-inspection labor hours, line-speed increase), each
    with editable inputs (defaults = the guide's own worked examples), a live-computed annual-savings
    result, a collapsible formula box, and a hint; a total card sums the three. **Deliberately simplified
    after the first version**: an initial-investment/payback-period feature and a recurring-annual-cost
    input existed briefly and were removed by request — the total card is now just the sum of the three
    annual savings, nothing else. The "annual production volume" field reads in **square meters produced
    (m²)**, not generic "pieces", to match the textile/fabric context. All labels/formulas/hints are
    bilingual (`translations.js` → `calculatorPage`); the numeric defaults and the calculation functions
    themselves live in `CalculatorPage.jsx` (`DEFAULTS`, `CALC`), not in translations, since they aren't
    language-dependent. Numeric inputs (`CalcNumberInput`) show thousand separators at rest and switch to
    raw digits while focused, so live comma-insertion doesn't disrupt typing/cursor position. **The
    section hints and the methodology note were rewritten once already** — the source guide phrases them
    for an internal salesperson ("qué datos pedirle al cliente", "cómo presentarlo ante el cliente"), but
    the actual reader is the website visitor filling out the calculator themselves, who *is* that client.
    All four were reframed to speak directly to the visitor ("usa tu tasa de defectos...", "con tu propio
    equipo..."). If more copy is ported from the source document later, apply the same reframing — don't
    carry over salesperson-perspective phrasing verbatim. **Known issue inherited from the source
    document, not fixed:** the line-speed section's worked example in the guide states an annual savings
    of $2,400,000 MXN, but applying the guide's own stated formula to that same example's numbers
    ((100−70) × 4,000 hrs × 0.5 units/m × $20/unit) yields $1,200,000 MXN — exactly half. The calculator
    implements the formula literally, so it shows $1,200,000 MXN for the default inputs, not the guide's
    $2,400,000 MXN. Flagged in `TODO.md` for the user to confirm which is right.
17. **Contact form has a "Schedule a meeting" mode** (`mode-toggle`, `mode` state), alongside the default
    "Send a message" mode. In schedule mode, `AppointmentPicker` (a hand-built month calendar, no date
    library) shows a fixed set of business-hour time slots — `09:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 16:00,
    17:00` — explicitly declared and labeled as **Mexico City time (CDMX)**, per an explicit "debe estar
    en horario méxico" requirement. These are illustrative fixed slots, not pulled from a real calendar
    or availability system — there is no backend, same limitation as the rest of the contact form (§11).
    Weekends and past dates are disabled in the calendar; the "previous month" nav button is disabled
    once viewing the current month (can't book in the past). Submission in schedule mode is blocked
    client-side (`field-error`, translated) until both a date and a time are picked; on success it shows
    `t.contact.successSchedule` instead of the generic `t.contact.success`. The current Mexico City clock
    time is shown for context via `Intl.DateTimeFormat(..., { timeZone: 'America/Mexico_City' })` — the
    one place real timezone conversion is used; the slot list itself is just fixed local-time strings,
    not converted from/to the visitor's own timezone.
18. **The calculator has a "soft savings" section** (`t.calculatorPage.softSavings`), below the total
    card, before the closing CTA — four qualitative benefit cards (customer trust, easier audits/
    certifications, employee experience, data-driven decisions) with no dollar figure, unlike the three
    formula-driven sections above them. **Not sourced from the ROI guide docx** (that document only
    covered the three quantifiable savings) — authored to round out the business case with the kind of
    benefits that are hard to put a number on but still matter. Reuses the existing `.usecases-grid
    why-grid` / `.usecase-card` / `.usecase-icon` visual pattern (§7) rather than inventing new card
    styling — icons: `shield`, `clipboard`, `spark`, `activity` (the last one reused from the "Why VeritX
    Vision" section).
19. **The calculator has a currency selector** (`.calc-currency`, above the three formula sections) —
    `t.calculatorPage.currencyOptions` follows the **same grouping convention as the contact form's
    country select** (§10.9): Mexico standalone first, then a "Latin America" `<optgroup>` (ARS, BOB,
    BRL, CLP, COP, CRC, DOP, GTQ, HNL, NIO, PYG, PEN, UYU, VES), then an "Other currencies" `<optgroup>`
    (USD, EUR) — keep new currencies in that same three-tier order, don't just alphabetize or append.
    **The calculator does not convert between currencies** — selecting a currency only changes the label
    suffix on the three monetary fields (`MONEY_FIELD_KEYS` in `CalculatorPage.jsx`: `costPerDefect`,
    `hourlyCost`, `marginPerUnit`) and the `Intl.NumberFormat` currency code used to render every result;
    the numbers the visitor types are trusted to already be in the selected currency. `formatCurrency(n,
    lang, currency)` replaced the old currency-hardcoded `formatMXN`.
20. **The calculator has a "send me these results" panel** (`.calc-send`, directly below the total
    card), collecting name + email and, on submit, just flips local `sent` state to show a thank-you
    message — **same no-backend pattern as the contact form** (§11), not a real email dispatch. An
    earlier version tried to route around the missing backend with a `mailto:` link (opening the
    visitor's own mail client with a pre-filled draft) — **explicitly replaced** after feedback that the
    flow should read as "you ask us, we handle sending it" (matching the Contact form's own framing),
    not "here's a drafted email, you send it yourself." Don't reintroduce the `mailto:` approach without
    a fresh request.
21. **The "How to read this" methodology note** (`t.calculatorPage.methodologyNote`) **lives inside the
    total-savings card** (`.calc-total`), directly under the total row — not as a standalone paragraph
    between the total card and the "send results" panel, which is where it originally sat. Styled via
    `.calc-total .calc-methodology` (translucent white text, no `max-width` cap) since it now sits on the
    total card's dark navy background instead of the page's light background.
22. **The nav/page label changed from "Calculator"/"Calculadora" to "Calculate Savings"/"Calcular
    ahorros"** (`t.nav.calculator`) — the page's own `<h1>` (`t.calculatorPage.title`, "Savings
    calculator"/"Calculadora de ahorro") was left as-is; only the short nav-entry name changed.
23. **The hero's middle stat chip is `'100%'` / "Of rolls inspected — not sampled"**, not the earlier
    `'Flexible'` / "Install adapts to your machine" — see §8's `Hero()` entry. Don't revert to a
    non-numeric stat there without a fresh request; the other two stats (`99.2%`, `~50%`) are unchanged.
24. **The About page includes a Mexico locator map** (`<MexicoMap/>`, inside `.about-facts`, below the
    HQ/coverage facts) highlighting Tlaxcala with its three true bordering states labeled (Puebla,
    Hidalgo, México/State of Mexico — verified by nearest-point distance against real boundary data, not
    guessed) and every other state rendered unlabeled for context. **Deliberately only the three
    neighbors are labeled, and Tlaxcala itself is not** — it's identified instead by fill color (solid
    cyan) plus a pulsing marker dot, with a small caption ("● Tlaxcala") below the map, per an explicit
    "highlight Tlaxcala, only label the neighboring states" request. See §14.7 for the data/build
    pipeline (this isn't hand-drawn — regenerate, don't hand-edit the path data if it ever needs to
    change).
25. **The About page has a "Vision" and "Mission" section** (`.vm-section`, its own `<section>` right
    after the intro/facts grid) — two cards (`vm-grid`/`vm-card`, reusing the `vf-icon` circular-icon
    pattern) under `t.about.vision` / `t.about.mission` (`icon`, `title`, `body`). Background is
    `var(--white)` via `.demo-section.vm-section` (needs both classes for specificity — see the CSS
    comment) so it visually separates from the gray-50 intro section above it.
26. **The Contact section's WhatsApp number and the footer's target LinkedIn URL are both currently
    unverified/placeholder-status from the codebase's point of view** — WhatsApp (`+52 246 241 6056`) was
    given directly by the user and is wired as a real `wa.me` link; LinkedIn has **no URL at all** yet
    (rendered as a non-linked icon — see §8's `Footer()` entry and §11). If asked to "add more social
    links" or "fix the WhatsApp number," check with the user for the real destination first — don't
    invent one.

---

## 11. Known gaps / intentionally unfinished

> This is a point-in-time snapshot. **`TODO.md` (repo root) is the live, user-editable version of this
> list** — check it for the current state and any notes the user has added since this was last synced,
> and update both when you close an item out (see §13).

- **The contact form does not submit anywhere — including appointment requests.** `Contact()`'s
  `handleSubmit` just calls `e.preventDefault()` and flips local `submitted` state to show a static
  success message (`t.contact.success` or, in schedule mode, `t.contact.successSchedule`). There is no
  backend, no email service (e.g. Formspree), no API call, and **no real calendar/availability system**
  behind the appointment picker — its time slots are a fixed illustrative list (§10.17), not checked
  against anyone's actual schedule, so double-booking isn't prevented. If the user asks "why didn't I
  get an email" or "why did it let two people pick the same slot", this is why — it's
  cosmetic/prototype-only, flagged previously, not yet wired up.
- **Footer "Company" column** now has exactly two real links: "About"/"Nosotros" (`href="#/about"`,
  wired to the real About page) and "Contact"/"Contacto" (`href="#contact"`). "Careers"/"Vacantes" was
  removed entirely (was a non-functional placeholder with no page behind it) — do not re-add a Careers
  link without a real destination for it.
- **Footer "Legal" column:** "Privacy Policy"/"Aviso de privacidad" and "Terms of Service"/"Términos de
  servicio" are also plain `<span>`s — no privacy-policy or terms-of-service page exists anywhere on
  the site (the contact form's own inline privacy blurb, §10.11, is the only privacy-related content
  that actually exists).
- **The line-speed example in the source ROI guide has an arithmetic inconsistency** — see §10.16.
  Flagged in `TODO.md` for the user to confirm which side (formula vs. example) is right.
- **No web font is actually loaded** — `index.css` requests `'Inter'` first in the font stack, but
  nothing imports/links Inter, so every browser silently falls back to its next system font.
- **No automated tests, no linter/formatter config.**
- **The footer's LinkedIn icon has no real URL** — rendered as a non-interactive `<span>`, not an
  `<a>`, specifically because no company LinkedIn page was provided (see §10.26). Wire it up as a real
  link (and probably add `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`, matching the WhatsApp link
  pattern) as soon as the user gives you the actual URL — don't fabricate one.
- **The entire customer portal (§14) is a client-only simulation, not a real backend.** This is the
  single biggest gap added this round — see §14.8 for the full breakdown (no real server, no real email
  delivery, SHA-256-in-JS instead of bcrypt/Argon2, client-side-only and trivially bypassable rate
  limiting, no audit log, no HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite session cookies since there's no server to set
  them). Read §14.8 before telling a user any part of the auth flow is "production-ready."

---

## 12. Recipes for common changes

- **Change copy in an existing section:** edit the matching keys in `translations.js`, in **both**
  `en` and `es` blocks. There's no fallback language — a missing key renders `undefined`.
- **Add a new home-page section:** write a new function component in `App.jsx` (steal the shape of an
  existing one, e.g. `UseCases()`), add a matching content object to `translations.js` (both
  languages), add its `<Whatever/>` to the `route === 'home'` block in `Site()`, and — if it should be
  reachable from the nav — add an entry to `nav.productItems` (marketing content) or `nav.aboutItems`
  (company-facing pages) in both languages, or add a new plain top-level link in `Header()` (see the
  `nav.calculator` link for the pattern) if it doesn't belong in either dropdown.
- **Add a brand-new page (own hash route):** create `src/WhateverPage.jsx` following the
  `AboutPage.jsx`/`CalculatorPage.jsx` pattern (`demo-hero` + `demo-section`), add a route branch in
  `useRoute()` and `Site()` (see §4), and add its translations under a new top-level key in both
  language blocks.
- **Add/replace an icon:** add an entry to `ICON_PATHS` in `icons.jsx` (see §6), reference it by name
  from wherever needs it.
- **Add a language:** see the end of §5.
- **Add a new customer-portal screen:** see §14.9.
- **Regenerate the Mexico map:** see §14.7.
- **Deploy:** just `git push` to `main`. Two targets build from the same push now — the GitHub Actions
  workflow (GitHub Pages) and Vercel's own git integration (no Action needed for that one, Vercel builds
  on push itself). See §2 for how `vite.config.js` tells the two builds apart.

---

## 13. `TODO.md` — the live task list

`TODO.md` (repo root, next to `README.md`) is a plain checklist file, explicitly requested as an
open, low-friction place for the user to jot down pending items and annotations over time — it is
**not** meant to be as structured or as exhaustively-reasoned as this SDD. Treat it as the
**current source of truth for "what's left to do"**; §11 above is a snapshot frozen at the time it was
written and will drift.

- When you finish something listed there, check it off (`- [x]`) rather than deleting it, so there's a
  visible record of what shipped.
- When you notice a new gap or the user asks for something to be tracked "for later" rather than done
  now, add it there instead of just mentioning it in chat.
- If closing out or adding an item there makes §11 of this SDD stale or inaccurate, update §11 to match
  in the same change — don't let the two documents disagree about what's outstanding.

## 14. Customer Portal (Login / Register / Recovery / Vision Home)

### 14.1 What this is and why it's built the way it is

A full login → register → verify-email → forgot-password/recover-username → account-dashboard flow,
added from a detailed client-supplied spec (security-conscious: generic non-enumerating error messages,
rate limiting, token expiry, hashed passwords, HttpOnly/Secure session cookies, audit logs — the kind of
spec you'd hand a team with a real backend). **This site has no backend and never has** (§2: static
Vite build, deployed to GitHub Pages/Vercel, no server runtime at all) — so rather than silently
dropping the request or blocking on "you need a backend first," the whole thing was built as a
**client-only simulation**: a `localStorage`-backed "auth service" (`auth.js`) standing in for a real
API, following the exact same precedent already established by the contact form and appointment picker
(§11) — fully clickable, end-to-end testable, honest in the UI and in this document about what's real
and what isn't. **Read §14.8 before presenting any part of this as production-ready to a user** — it is
not, by design, and several of the spec's actual security requirements (bcrypt/Argon2, server-side rate
limiting, audit logs, HttpOnly cookies) are architecturally impossible without a real backend.

Routes: see the table in §4. Files: see §3 (`auth.js`, `LoginPage.jsx`, `RegisterPage.jsx`,
`VerifyEmailPage.jsx`, `ForgotPasswordPage.jsx`, `RecoverUsernamePage.jsx`, `VisionHomePage.jsx`,
`MexicoMap.jsx`, `mexicoMapData.js`). Translations: one top-level `auth` key in `translations.js` (both
languages) — `navLogin`, `navAccount`, `dummy`, `login`, `register`, `verifyEmail`, `forgotPassword`,
`resetPassword`, `recoverUsername`, `visionHome`. **Not reproduced verbatim in §9** (unlike the rest of
the site's copy) — it's large and would bloat this document without much benefit; read `translations.js`
directly for exact strings, and treat this section as the shape/behavior reference instead.

Shared visual pattern: every portal page uses the same `demo-hero` + `demo-section` shell as the other
satellite pages (§7), with form content centered in a new `.auth-shell`/`.auth-card` wrapper
(`.auth-card` just adds the `.lead-form` white-card look to a narrower, centered column). Password
fields use a shared `.password-field`/`.password-toggle` pattern (`eye`/`eyeOff` icons, §6). Demo-mode
disclosures use a shared `.dummy-panel` component style (amber, `flask` icon) across the dummy-login
banner, the register/forgot-password "here's your verification/reset link" boxes, and the
recover-username "here's your username" box.

### 14.2 `auth.js` — the simulated backend

Everything is `localStorage`-backed, under `veritx-auth-*` keys:

| key | shape | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `veritx-auth-users` | `[{ firstName, lastName, email, username, passwordHash, verified, createdAt, account }]` | the "user table". `account` is `null` for every freshly registered user (§14.6's empty state) or a `{status, subscriptions, payments}` object. |
| `veritx-auth-session` | `{ username, isDummy, loginAt } \| null` | the "session" — just a localStorage value, not a cookie (see §14.8). |
| `veritx-auth-verify-tokens` | `[{ token, username, expiresAt }]` | 24h TTL. **Not deleted on successful verification** (see the StrictMode note below) — only pruned by expiry. |
| `veritx-auth-reset-tokens` | `[{ token, username, expiresAt }]` | 30min TTL. Deleted on successful use (one-shot, unlike verify tokens — see below for why the two behave differently). |
| `veritx-auth-attempts` | `{ [identifier]: { count, lockedUntil } }` | per-identifier failed-login counter for the rate-limit simulation. |

Passwords are hashed with `crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', ...)` before being stored — **not a
substitute for server-side bcrypt/Argon2** (no salt rounds, no memory-hardness; this is purely "don't
keep raw plaintext sitting in localStorage," not real credential security) — see §14.8.

**Dummy test login** (`test` / `vision`, per the original spec's "modo de prueba"): checked directly
inside `login()`, gated behind `export const IS_DUMMY_LOGIN_ENABLED = import.meta.env.DEV`. This is a
**real, load-bearing gate, not just a UI banner** — Vite replaces `import.meta.env.DEV` with the literal
`false` at build time for a production build (`npm run build`, which is what both GitHub Pages and
Vercel run — §2), so the entire dummy-login code path is dead code and unreachable on the live sites,
satisfying the spec's "must be fully disabled in production" requirement for real, not just cosmetically
via a banner. It only actually works under `npm run dev`. A logged-in dummy session resolves (in
`getCurrentUser()`) to a fixed in-memory `DEMO_ACCOUNT` (2 active subscriptions, 2 upcoming payments) so
the "account assigned" state of Vision Home (§14.6) has something to render in dev without needing to
register a real user first.

**Rate limiting** (`login()`): after `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5` failed attempts for the same identifier
(email/username, lowercased), a 60s lockout is recorded in `veritx-auth-attempts` and further attempts
return `{ok:false, error:'locked'}` until it expires. **This is client-side only and trivially
bypassable** (clear `localStorage`, or just call `auth.js`'s exports directly from the console) — it
exists to make the UI demonstrate the *behavior* the spec asked for, not to actually rate-limit anyone.
Real rate limiting needs a backend. Flagged again in §14.8/§11.

**Cross-component reactivity — `useAuthSession()`:** components (`Header()`, `VisionHomePage`) need to
re-render when login/logout happens *in the same tab*, which a plain `localStorage` read on mount can't
do (the browser's own `storage` event only fires in *other* tabs). `auth.js` keeps a small in-module
`Set` of listener callbacks; `login()`/`logout()` call an internal `notifyAuthChange()` after writing to
`veritx-auth-session`, and `useAuthSession()` (a hook, also exported from `auth.js`) subscribes to that
set plus the cross-tab `storage` event, returning the current session and forcing a re-render on either
signal. If you add a new place that needs to know "is someone logged in," use this hook — don't read
`getSession()` once and cache it in local state, it'll go stale the moment the user logs in/out
elsewhere on the page.

**A real bug found and fixed during this build, worth knowing about if you touch `verifyEmailToken` or
`ResetPasswordView` again:** `src/main.jsx` wraps the app in `React.StrictMode`, which **double-invokes
effects in development** as a side-effect-detection aid (not present in production builds). Two spots
in this codebase are/were sensitive to that:
- `verifyEmailToken(token)` used to delete the token from `veritx-auth-verify-tokens` on success. Under
  StrictMode, `VerifyEmailPage`'s mount effect ran twice: the first call verified and deleted the token;
  the second call, immediately after, found no token and returned `'invalid'` — overwriting the
  already-correct "success" UI state with an error, in dev only. **Fixed by making the function
  idempotent instead of one-shot**: it now checks `if (!user.verified)` before flipping the flag and
  never deletes the token (only expiry prunes it) — verifying an already-verified account is a no-op
  success, not an error. This is also just more *correct* behavior on its own merits (a user re-clicking
  an old confirmation email link, or a mail client prefetching the link, shouldn't see "invalid link"
  for a token that already worked), not only a StrictMode workaround.
- `ForgotPasswordPage`'s `ResetPasswordView` computed `const check = validateResetToken(token)` directly
  in the render body. `resetPassword()` *does* delete the reset token on success (intentionally — unlike
  verify tokens, a password-reset link should be genuinely one-shot). After a successful submit,
  `setDone(true)` triggers a re-render, which re-ran `validateResetToken` against the now-deleted token
  and got `invalid` — and since the component checked `!check.ok` before checking `done`, it showed
  "this link is invalid or expired" instead of "password updated," even though the password change had
  already succeeded. **Fixed by freezing `check` at mount** via `useState(() => validateResetToken(token))`
  instead of recomputing it every render. General lesson for this codebase: **never call a
  token-consuming `auth.js` function directly in a render body or in an effect without a stable
  freeze/guard** — validity checks that have side effects (or that check state a submit handler is about
  to mutate) need to be computed once, not on every re-render.

### 14.3 Login (`LoginPage.jsx`)

Fields: identifier (email or username) + password (with show/hide toggle). `IS_DUMMY_LOGIN_ENABLED`
gates a `.dummy-panel` above the form with a "fill in test credentials" button (sets the fields to
`test`/`vision` — doesn't auto-submit). Errors are looked up from `t.auth.login.errors` by the error
code `login()` returns (`invalid_credentials`, `unverified`, `locked`) — generic on purpose, per the
non-enumeration requirement in the original spec (never says which of email/username/password was
wrong). Success navigates to `#/vision-home` via `window.location.hash = ...`.

### 14.4 Register (`RegisterPage.jsx`) + email verification (`VerifyEmailPage.jsx`)

Fields: first name, last name, email, username, password, confirm password. Client-side validation
(`isValidEmail`, `isValidUsername`, `isPasswordCommon`, password length ≥ 12, confirm-match) runs
before calling `registerUser()`. **Email uniqueness is enumeration-safe** (a duplicate email still
returns `{ok:true}` with no verification token, so the UI can't distinguish "sent" from "already
registered" — matching the spec's "don't reveal if an email exists" requirement); **username
uniqueness is not** (`{ok:false, error:'username_taken'}`, shown inline) — this asymmetry is
intentional and mirrors the source spec, which treats username availability as normal expected UX (like
any signup form) but treats email existence as sensitive.

On success, the page shows a "check your email" screen with `t.auth.register.successBody`, and —
**because there is no real email service** — a `.dummy-panel` showing the actual
`#/verify-email?token=...` link directly in the page (always shown when a token exists, not gated to
`IS_DUMMY_LOGIN_ENABLED`, since without it there's no way to complete the flow in this demo at all — the
gate only controls the fixed `test`/`vision` shortcut credentials, not the general "no backend" reality
of the rest of the portal). `VerifyEmailPage` reads the token from the hash query string, calls
`verifyEmailToken()` (idempotent — §14.2), and shows success/error accordingly.

### 14.5 Forgot password / recover username (`ForgotPasswordPage.jsx`, `RecoverUsernamePage.jsx`)

`ForgotPasswordPage` is **one component covering two views**, switched on whether `?token=` is present
in the hash: no token → `RequestView` (identifier input, generic "if registered..." message + dev-panel
reset link on submit); token present → `ResetPasswordView` (new password + confirm, blocked client-side
below 12 chars / a common password / mismatch, then `resetPassword()` — which also calls `logout()`
internally so any existing session is invalidated after a password change, and clears that identifier's
rate-limit counter). `RecoverUsernamePage` is the simpler one-view equivalent for "I forgot my
username" — email in, generic message + dev-panel showing the actual username out. Both request views
return the same generic copy regardless of whether the identifier actually matched a user, per the
non-enumeration requirement (§14.2/§14.4).

**Scroll-into-view on every state transition:** all four success/result screens across these two files
(register's "check your email," the two forgot-password result states, recover-username's result) use
the same `resultRef`/`doneRef` + `useEffect(() => ref.current?.scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth',
block:'center'}), [state])` pattern already established for the contact form (§8's `Contact()` entry).
Reason: these pages are short, but submitting can still shrink the visible content (a filled form
collapsing to a couple of lines of success text) enough that, on a scrolled-down viewport, the result
would otherwise render below the fold with the footer covering it — flagged explicitly during testing
("cada vez que un formulario se completa, el footer le quita el espacio... haz scroll automático").
Apply the same pattern to any new form/result transition added to these pages.

### 14.6 Vision Home (`VisionHomePage.jsx`) — the account dashboard

**Route guard:** not a real protected route (there's no server to enforce that) — a `useEffect` checks
`useAuthSession()` on render and redirects to `#/login` if there's no session; the component returns
`null` until a session exists, so there's no flash of dashboard content before the redirect fires.

**Breadcrumb, not an eyebrow pill:** unlike every other satellite page (which use the `.eyebrow` pill in
the dark `demo-hero` banner — §7), Vision Home uses a `.breadcrumb` ("Home / Vision Home") **inside the
light `demo-section` content area**, above the dummy-panel/cards — not in the dark hero. This was an
explicit two-step change: first the eyebrow pill was replaced with a breadcrumb, then the breadcrumb
was moved out of the hero into the content section. If Vision Home ever needs breadcrumbs again
elsewhere, follow this placement (content section, not hero) rather than the eyebrow-pill convention
used everywhere else.

**Two account states**, driven by `getCurrentUser().account`:
- **No account** (`account === null` — the state every freshly registered real user starts in):
  `.vh-empty-state` card, "You don't have an account assigned yet," with two CTAs that both link to
  `#contact` (the *marketing* Contact section, on the `home` route) rather than opening any dashboard-
  local form — reuses the site's one real lead-capture surface instead of duplicating it.
- **Account assigned** (dummy test login always has one — `DEMO_ACCOUNT`, §14.2): a `.vh-grid` of three
  cards — Active Subscriptions (list + count), Next Payment Date (soonest of `account.payments`, with a
  "view all" toggle), Amount to Pay (next payment's amount, with a "view billing detail" toggle listing
  subscription names). All dates/currency formatted via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`/`Intl.NumberFormat` for
  the current `lang`.

**Support + appointment cards** (below the state-dependent block above, shown regardless of account
state): "Technical support" opens an inline `SupportTicketForm` (subject, description, priority select —
**no file-attachment field**, since there's nowhere for an upload to go without a backend; flagged in
§11/TODO) that on submit just flips local `sent` state, same no-backend pattern as everything else here.
"Schedule a meeting" is a **plain link to `#contact`**, not a duplicated appointment widget — the
marketing Contact section already has a full working `AppointmentPicker` (§10.17); this CTA deliberately
reuses it instead of re-implementing a second calendar component inline. Don't build a second
`AppointmentPicker` for Vision Home without a specific reason to diverge from the existing one.

**Logout lives in the header's account dropdown, not on this page.** An earlier version had a standalone
"Log out" button in Vision Home's own header row — **explicitly moved** into the `Header()` account
dropdown (§8's `Header()` entry) after feedback that it belonged in a menu behind the account icon, not
as a page-level button. The status badge ("Active"/"Trial"/"Pending assignment," `t.auth.visionHome.status`)
that used to sit next to that button was also removed outright (not relocated) in the same pass — the
`status`/`status-active`/`status-trial`/`status-pending` CSS and the badge markup are gone; the
translation keys under `t.auth.visionHome.status` are still defined (reused by the subscription-list
pills, `.vh-pill`) but nothing currently renders a page-level account-status badge. Don't re-add one
without checking whether that omission was intentional (it was) or just re-add it as a
`.vh-pill`-style badge if asked.

### 14.7 Mexico locator map (`MexicoMap.jsx` / `mexicoMapData.js`)

Used by `AboutPage.jsx` (§10.24), not part of the auth system itself, but built in the same session and
documented here since it's a generated-data component like nothing else in this codebase.

**Data provenance:** `mexicoMapData.js` was generated once from a public-domain Mexico state-boundary
GeoJSON (`angelnmara/geojson`, file `mexicoHigh.json` — a small, precise, MIT-ish-licensed dataset
commonly used in D3 Mexico-choropleth tutorials; fetched directly, not eyeballed/hand-drawn) via a
one-off Node script (not checked into the repo — this was a scratch/throwaway build step, not a
reusable tool). The script: (1) projects lon/lat to a 760×481 SVG viewbox using a simple
equirectangular projection with longitude scaled by `cos(meanLatitude)` to reduce east-west distortion
at Mexico's latitude; (2) simplifies every ring with a from-scratch Douglas-Peucker implementation
(ε≈0.7px in projected space) to cut a ~185KB raw GeoJSON down to ~30KB of SVG path data — still enough
detail to read as "Mexico," light enough to inline; (3) computes each state's area-weighted centroid
(shoelace formula) on its largest ring, for icon/label placement; (4) **verifies Tlaxcala's true
neighbors by nearest-point distance** between polygons rather than guessing from memory — confirmed
Puebla, Hidalgo, and México (State of Mexico) all touch Tlaxcala (distance 0) and Veracruz/CDMX/Morelos
don't (0.24–0.34° away), which is what's reflected in the "only label the neighbors" behavior (§10.24).

**Label placement:** neighbor labels use **manually nudged offsets** (`LABEL_OFFSET` in
`MexicoMap.jsx`), not the raw computed centroids — Puebla's area-weighted centroid lands almost on top
of Tlaxcala's tiny shape (Puebla wraps around most of it), so the raw centroid would put "Puebla" text
directly over the highlighted state. The nudges push each label into open space inside that state's own
territory instead. If the map is ever regenerated from source data, **re-check these offsets** — a
different simplification epsilon or projection could shift centroids enough to need new nudge values.

**To regenerate:** re-fetch `mexicoHigh.json` (or an updated equivalent), re-run the same
projection/simplification/centroid steps described above (rewrite the one-off script — it wasn't
retained), re-verify neighbor adjacency by distance rather than assuming it hasn't changed, and
re-tune `LABEL_OFFSET`. **Never hand-edit coordinates in `mexicoMapData.js` directly** — the `d` path
strings are generated, not authored; treat the file as a build artifact.

### 14.8 What's real vs. simulated — read before calling any of this "done"

| Spec requirement | Status here |
|---|---|
| Dummy/test login disabled in production | ✅ Real — `import.meta.env.DEV` gate, dead-code-eliminated in prod builds (§14.2) |
| Generic, non-enumerating error messages | ✅ Real UX behavior (client-side), though there's no server to enforce it against a determined attacker |
| Password length / common-password checks | ✅ Real client-side checks (`isPasswordCommon` is a small hardcoded list, not a real breach-database lookup like HaveIBeenPwned) |
| Passwords hashed, not stored in plaintext | ⚠️ Partial — SHA-256 via Web Crypto, client-side. **Not** bcrypt/Argon2 with per-user salt and tunable work factor; a real backend is required for that |
| Email verification / password reset via token | ⚠️ Partial — real token generation (`crypto.getRandomValues`), real expiry, real one-shot consumption for reset tokens. **No real email is ever sent** — the token/link is shown directly in the UI in a labeled "demo mode" panel |
| Rate limiting on failed logins | ⚠️ Partial — real UI/UX behavior, but enforced in `localStorage`, so trivially bypassed by clearing storage or calling `auth.js` directly. Real rate limiting needs a backend |
| Session cookies with `Secure`/`HttpOnly`/`SameSite`, session-ID regeneration on login | ❌ Not applicable/implemented — there is no server to set cookies. "Session" is a `localStorage` value read by client JS, which is a fundamentally weaker model (readable/writable by any script on the page) than an HttpOnly cookie |
| Audit logs (registration, login attempts, password/recovery events) | ❌ Not implemented — nothing is logged anywhere durable; `localStorage` state changes aren't an audit trail |
| HTTPS everywhere | ✅ Real, but incidental — GitHub Pages and Vercel both serve over HTTPS by default, not something this app configures itself |

If a user asks to "make the login real" or "add a real backend," that's a substantially different,
much larger project (an actual API + database + email service + hosting for that service) — not a
tweak to the existing files. Flag that scope difference explicitly rather than trying to bolt real
security onto the `localStorage` simulation.

### 14.9 Recipe: add a new customer-portal screen

Follow the existing five pages as the template. Create `src/WhateverPortalPage.jsx` using the
`demo-hero` + `demo-section` + `.auth-shell`/`.auth-card` shell (§14.1); add any new `auth.js` functions
needed (keep the "generic message regardless of whether the identifier matched" pattern for anything
recovery-related, and remember the StrictMode-idempotency lesson in §14.2 if the new screen consumes a
token on mount); add a route branch in `useRoute()`/`Site()` and to the `SATELLITE_ROUTES` array (§4);
add translations under `t.auth.whatever` in both languages (don't reproduce them in §9 — see §14.1); and
if the new screen has a "did this action succeed" transition that can shrink the page's content, add the
`resultRef`/`scrollIntoView` pattern from §14.5.
